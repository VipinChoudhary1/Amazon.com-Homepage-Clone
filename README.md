# Amazon.com-Homepage-Clone
 This project is a clone of the homepage of Amazon.com, created using only HTML and CSS. The aim of this project was to practice and enhance my front-end development skills by replicating the layout and design of a well-known website.
Features
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
HTML and CSS Only: No JavaScript or external frameworks were used, focusing solely on HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
Visual Accuracy: The design closely mirrors the look and feel of the actual Amazon homepage, including the header, footer, and main content areas.
